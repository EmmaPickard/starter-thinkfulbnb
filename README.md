This assignment entailed utilizing flex box to create a landing page for a fake company. 

For this assignment, I have implemented Thinkfulbnb's landing page in HTML & CSS. Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

#### Media query: Desktop view

I completed the following tasks to create my Desktop view:

- In `style.css`, create a media query for screens that are wider than `480px`.

Within the media query, write CSS to create the following designs for desktop:

- The logo and the navigation menu links should be spaced apart from each other, like this:

![Navigation desktop](./images/navigation-desktop.png)

- The search form input fields and the button should be horizontally aligned, like this:

![Search form desktop](./images/search-form-desktop.png)

- The items in the "About" section should be horizontally aligned. The paragraph content should be vertically centered and always be about twice as wide as each image item, like this:

![About desktop](./images/about-desktop.png)

- The "Ideas" images should be displayed in a 2 by 2 grid (see the desktop design shared above).

- The items in the "Want to Become a Thinkful Host?" section should be horizontally aligned. The paragraph content should be vertically centered and be as wide as each image item, like this:
